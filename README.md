# Project: not moogle docs

![Logo](docs/logo.png)

## üî¥ **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to combine the powerful note-taking and linking features of **Obsidian** with the collaborative capabilities of platforms like **Google Docs**. The system is designed to allow users to work together without relying on the paid Obsidian Sync service.

## üìÇ **Features**
- Users can edit their notes simultaneously.
- Users can create **links between notes**, which are visualized through an **interactive knowledge graph**.
- **In-app notifications** allow users to invite friends directly to collaborate on notes and vaults.
- Each user is assigned a specific **role**:
  - **Owner**
  - **Editor**
- Users can only access notes where they are **participants** and can view or edit content based on their assigned role.
- The **role-based authorization** system simplifies access control and makes team collaboration more organized and secure.
- A **modular and user-friendly design** hides technical complexity behind a clean and intuitive interface.

## üë®üèæ‚Äçüîß **Technologies Used:**

CHAT IS MISSING! (FIREBASE API IS MISSING!)

### **‚öôÔ∏è Backend:**

| **Technology**        | **Purpose**   | **Source** | 
|--------------------| ---------- | ------------------ |
| Spring Boot 2.4 | A Java-based framework that simplifies backend development, particularly for building RESTful APIs. | [SpringBoot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.4.0/reference/htmlsingle/)| 
| JWT | A secure and compact mechanism for transmitting user session information. Enables stateless authentication between client and server. | [JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction) | 
| MariaDB | A fast and reliable open-source relational database. Stores core application data such as users, vaults, notes, and permission settings. | [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/documentation/) | 
| Yjs | A CRDT-based collaboration framework enabling concurrent editing by multiple users. Facilitates real-time synchronization of shared documents. | [Yjs](https://yjs.dev/) | 
| Docker | A platform for building, shipping, and running applications in isolated containers. Ensures consistent development and deployment environments across systems. | [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) | 
| WebSocket | A communication protocol for real-time, bidirectional messaging between the browser and server. Enables features like collaborative note editing. | [WebSocket](github.com/websockets/ws) | 

## **üë®üèº‚Äçüíª Main Components:**

### **‚öôÔ∏è Backend:**

| **Component**        | **Purpose**   | **Link** | 
|--------------------| ---------- | ------------------ |
| UserController | Handles user authentication and registration. | []()| 
| Vault Controller | Manages CRUD operations for vaults, including listing and creating. |  | 
| Note Controller | Handles all note-related endpoints under a vault. | | 
| Vault Permission Controller | Manages sharing logic by assigning user roles (OWNER, EDITOR) to vaults. | | 
| JwtFilter & JwtUtil |Extracts and validates the token for secured requests. |  | 

## **üë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄ Launch & Deployment:**

### **‚öôÔ∏è Backend:**
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Build the project**
```
docker-compose build 
```
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Run the application**
```
docker-compose up
```
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Run backend tests**
```
./gradlew test
```
### **üï∏Ô∏è Websocket Development:**

First expose port 8080 in Dockerfile and change port 1234 to 8080 in server.js; also set isProduction to true. 

Then run:
```
cd yjs/
```
```
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/sopra-fs25-group-42-server/yjs-server:latest.
```
```
3. gcloud run deploy yjs-server \
```

```
  --image gcr.io/sopra-fs25-group-42-server/yjs-server:latest \
  --platform managed \
  --region europe-west6 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --memory 1Gi \
  --concurrency 50 \
  --timeout 3600 \
  --min-instances 1 \
  --max-instances 3

### üìà **Potential Improvements:**

#### **PDF Upload & Note Extraction:**
- Enable users to upload a PDF and automatically generate notes from its content (can be ideal for research papers), reports, or contracts.

#### **Role Change Notifications:**
- Instead of instantly updating roles on the notes settings page, show a user-friendly notification when someone‚Äôs permission level is changed.
