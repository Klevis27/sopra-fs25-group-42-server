# Project: not moogle docs

![Logo](docs/logo.png)

## 🔴 **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to combine the powerful note-taking and linking features of **Obsidian** with the collaborative capabilities of platforms like **Google Docs**. The system is designed to allow users to work together without relying on the paid Obsidian Sync service.

## 📂 **Features**
- Users can edit their notes simultaneously.
- Users can create **links between notes**, which are visualized through an **interactive knowledge graph**.
- **In-app notifications** allow users to invite friends directly to collaborate on notes and vaults.
- Each user is assigned a specific **role**:
  - **Owner**
  - **Editor**
- Users can only access notes where they are **participants** and can view or edit content based on their assigned role.
- The **role-based authorization** system simplifies access control and makes team collaboration more organized and secure.
- A **modular and user-friendly design** hides technical complexity behind a clean and intuitive interface.

## 👨🏾‍🔧 **Technologies Used:**

CHAT IS MISSING! (FIREBASE API IS MISSING!)

### **🚀 Frontend:**

| **Technology**        | **Purpose**   | **Source** | 
|--------------------| ---------- | ------------------ |
| Next.js 15 | A React framework that supports serverside rendering and a modern file-based routing system. | [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs)| 
| React 19 | A component-based JavaScript library for building fast and responsive user interfaces. | [React](https://react.dev) | 
| TypeScript 5 | A statically typed superset of JavaScript that improves code safety and developer experience. | [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs) |

| MariaDB | A fast and reliable open-source relational database. Stores core application data such as users, vaults, notes, and permission settings. | [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/documentation/) | 
| Redis | An in-memory key-value data store. Used for session caching and syncing real-time collaborative editing. | [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/) | 
| Yjs | A CRDT-based collaboration framework enabling concurrent editing by multiple users. Facilitates real-time synchronization of shared documents. | [Yjs](https://yjs.dev/) | 
| Docker | A platform for building, shipping, and running applications in isolated containers. Ensures consistent development and deployment environments across systems. | [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) | 

## **👨🏼‍💻 Main Components:**

### **🚀 Frontend:**

| **Component**        | **Purpose**   | **Link** |

### 📈 **Potential Improvements:**

#### **PDF Upload & Note Extraction:**
- Enable users to upload a PDF and automatically generate notes from its content (can be ideal for research papers), reports, or contracts.

#### **Role Change Notifications:**
- Instead of instantly updating roles on the notes settings page, show a user-friendly notification when someone’s permission level is changed.
